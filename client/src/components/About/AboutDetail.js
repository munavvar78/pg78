            <h1>The daunting process of finding a new home made easy</h1>

            <p>
              BookMyPG was started by Thinkwide Hospitality as a solution to the
              intimidating and tiresome process of looking for a new home in a
              new city.

              The speed with which young adults move from one city to another to
              pursue their dreams is marvelous, and we are here to support their
              dream by providing them with more than just a house.

              PGO is the first of its kind technology startup that connects
              accommodation seekers and providers on a single platform, cutting
              out the middle-man. We aim to provide a transparent platform where
              users can see an aggregated list of verified PGs and Hostels to
              choose from. Users can see the reviews, tariffs, availability and
              other details all in one place. Our users are young adults who are
              passionate, determined and are aspiring to live their best lives.

            <h1>We create communities</h1>
            <p>
              All our properties represent a sense of belongingness that makes
              it a home and not just a place where you stay. We know that our
              customers work long hours and travel on roads full of jams, and
              thatâ€™s why we make our properties homely. So, you feel relaxed
              when you come back.

              Our residents, or as we call them, PGO Amigos are a bunch of
              warm-hearted and welcoming people. We hold regular events like
              meet-ups, parties, bonfires, networking, movie nights and every
              other form of entertainment to give people a chance to know each
              other.
